    <h2>Introducing CSS3</h2>
What You’ll Learn in This Hour:
<ul>
<li>Some of the new abilities CSS3 brings to CSS</li>
<li>Using vendor-specific prefixes and extensions</li>
<li>Cross-browser setting of CSS3 properties</li>
<li>Setting CSS3 properties efficiently in JavaScript</li>

Using CSS3 you can easily achieve plenty of cool new effects without having to use lots of JavaScript code and/or external graphics applications such as Photoshop. You can create rounded borders, add shadows to boxes, use an image as a border, and more. CSS3 contains several new background properties that give you more control over background elements, including multiple background images, while CSS3 gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. New text features include text shadows and word wrap, as well as easy use of web fonts. And CSS3 lets you easily build really cool transitions, transformations, and animations.

In this hour you’ll get a flavor of what CSS3 can do for your web pages, and you’ll see how to effectively control CSS3’s capabilities using JavaScript.
    <h2>Vendor Specific Properties and Prefixes</h2>
    CSS vendor prefixes are a way for the browser companies to add support for new or experimental CSS features before they become part of the formal CSS3 specification, or to implement features of a specification that hasn’t yet been finalized. In due course, these prefixes usually become unnecessary as the features become fully supported via their standard CSS3 nomenclature. To make sure that your pages render as you want them to in the maximum number of browsers, though, it pays to use prefixes.

    The CSS3 browser prefixes you’re likely to need appear in Table 13.1. Image

    TABLE 13.1 Vendor Prefixes for CSS3

    In most cases, where a prefix is necessary you take the CSS3 property as listed in the CSS3 specification and add the relevant prefix from Table 13.1 for the browser in use. For example, later in this hour you’ll read about CSS3 transitions. There you’ll see that, if you want to add a CSS3 transition to your page, you use the transition property with the prefixes added first:

    Tip

    At the time of writing there’s a really useful roundup of which feature/browser combinations require a prefix at http://shouldiprefix.com/.

    For a frequently updated list of which features are supported by a particular browser and version, visit http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_browsersupport.asp.

    -webkit-transition: background 0.5s ease; -moz-transition: background 0.5s ease; -o-transition: background 0.5s ease; transition: background 0.5s ease;

    The user’s browser will respond to whichever version of the transition feature it understands, ignoring the rest.

    Thankfully, browser manufacturers are working hard at fully implementing all of the CSS3 features, and for most modern browsers the number of properties requiring a prefix is falling quickly.
    <h2>CSS3 Borders</h2>
    CSS3 Borders
CSS3 lets you do some really cool things with borders that were only previously possible with lots of ugly, hard-to-maintain code hacks.

In this section we’ll look at two examples: box shadows and rounded corners. Create Box Shadows

The box-shadow property lets you add drop shadows to your page’s box elements. As Table 13.2 shows, you can separately specify values for color, size, blur, and offset: Image

TABLE 13.2 Parameters for the box-shadow Property

Here’s an example using a 10px-wide shadow heading down and to the right, blurred across its full width, and colored mid-grey:

#div1 { background-color: #8080ff; width: 400px; height: 250px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px #808080; -webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px #808080; -moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px #808080; }

In Figure 13.1 you can see an example of this style applied to a

element in a web page. Image

Rounding Corners with the border-radius property
The border-radius property lets you add rounded corners to your page elements without the need for specially created corner images, and is perhaps one of the most popular features new to CSS3.

The border-radius property already has widespread browser support, though Mozilla Firefox required the -moz- prefix for a little longer than some of its rivals; therefore, if you need to support Firefox back several versions you should consider including the prefixed version too:

#div1 { -moz-border-radius: 25px; border-radius: 25px; }

In Figure 13.2 you can see an example of a

element styled with radiused corners. Image

Rounded corners can be specified independently using the individual properties border-bottom-left-radius, border-top-left-radius, border-bottom-right-radius, and border-bottom-right-radius, or for all four corners in one statement by using the border-radius property, as we’ve done here.

Caution

The prefixed version of a property might not always be exactly the same as the property as described in the CSS3 specification.

Even though vendor-specific extensions usually avoid conflicts (as each vendor has a unique prefix), please remember that such extensions may also be subject to change by the vendor, as they do not form part of the CSS3 specifications, even though they try to behave like the forthcoming CSS3 properties.

Remember, too, that the vendor-specific extensions will almost certainly fail CSS validation.
